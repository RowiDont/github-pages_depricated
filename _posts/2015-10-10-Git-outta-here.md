I can't Git over how powerful it is. Sorry, last git pun, I swear.

I've just completed the [Udacity course on Git and Github](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud775), and I learned way more than I expected to. It was really in depth, and had a lot of exercises to get familiar with Git. I'm really glad I took it before continuing the web dev track.

In fact, I finally cloned this blog to my local computer, I created this post within git bash, and I'm writing this right now in Atom editor. In a couple minutes I'll be committing this post, and push it to master, and it will be live in seconds, all without touching Github.com.

### Atom.io

Realizing what was possible with Git got me thinking about Atom, the text editor I have decided to use. Honestly, I probably would have gone with sublime had I known about it, but by the time I learned, I was settled into Atom.

My background is in materials science, so I think I also appreciate the name. I've installed some cool packages that both make it look killer, and also function better.

There isn't all that much to say, really. Git has changed the way I think about development, and Atom has made that development a whole lot easier.

再见!

(oh right, in completely unrelated news I've decided it's time to start brushing up on my chinese)
