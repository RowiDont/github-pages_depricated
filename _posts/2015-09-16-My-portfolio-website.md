## "Finished" the HTML/CSS final project

I have spent a good deal of time getting my Portfolio website to be responsive. I think  the concept of Mobile First will take a while to sink in, as right now I am still spending lots of time getting the desktop version to look how I want. I think once implementing a website design becomes more intuitive, it will be easier to think about mobile platforms from the beginning.

The word _finished_ is in quotation marks because I hope that as I go through future courses I will learn new techniques that I can implement in my code. I'd very much like to change the modal a bit, for instance. But I am going to be patient about that one and wait till I get to Javascript in a week. At the moment, I am taking two classes that focus on website responsiveness and optimization. I had already coded my portfolio and tested it on mobile devices, but that was through my own google searching and using stackoverflow. It's very helpful seeing professionals work through many of the problems I encountered.

#### Inspiration

An instructor on Udacity had us look for a webstie we thought did responsive design well. I found a webstie from Crop Trust, which I believe is the organization that is creating essentially a library in the arcitc tundra. A sort of last resort should something bad happen to the environment. You can see it [here](https://www.croptrust.org/2014/home). The level of activity smoothly going on on that page is really inspiring, and I hope that by the time I graduate a boot-camp, I'll be able to create a similarly complex and interactive website.
