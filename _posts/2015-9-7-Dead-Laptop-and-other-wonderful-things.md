## Progress on some fronts

### The struggle is real

It's been a pretty long time since my first post, but I haven't been idle. The goal of this blog is to show code camps that I really am dedicated to a career in this field. To that end, I'm taking the first steps towards learning, by myself. Way back when I first posted, I had just started taking the class titled [Web Development](https://www.udacity.com/course/web-development--cs253) on Udacity. Unfortunatel, I realized during Lesson 2, I did not have the prerequisites to take the class. Python was the programming language used throughout the course, and I have never written so much as a line of code in it. I was really sad. I'd put in a couple full days of work getting through lesson 1 and half of lesson 2, and I was already over my head. But the next day I started another class I found on Udactiy, and I'm loving it.

### Starting from the bottom

Udacity has Nanodegree programs where you can pay $200/mo and eventually get certified within a track. They offer all the coursework, lesson plans, and even grading rubrics free of charge, and that's what I decided to use. I've picked the Front-end Web Developer Nanodegree track, and am about to complete the final project for the first class, [Intro to HTML and CSS](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-html-and-css--ud304).

The project for the class is to recreate a provided web design in html/css. I misunderstood some instructions during the end of Lesson 2, and actually went ahead and fully worked out a functioning website, even featuring responsive design elements, which I'm pretty proud of. You can see my website [here](http://berlin-way-3652.pancakeapps.com/), hosted on dropbox using a neat little website called [pancake.io](pancake.io).

### Learning by trial and error

So far using CSS has been a lot of trial and error, but getting my website to actually work, and look like what I wanted it to look like, was an amazing learning experience. I don't know if the course makers intended for us to do what I did, but that doesn't really matter. When Bootstrap was introduced in Lesson 3, I understood what was behind all the different classes we were using, because I had _made_ those classes myself in the previous lesson, from 12 different column classes, to responsive images and centered text.

### The Broken laptop, the lesson learned

I bought a fancy new laptop, the ASUS UX305FA, almost a month ago. My current craptop is a celeron antique, purchased for $200 at bestbuy a million years ago. When I started using my new laptop, I felt like I was in heaven. For about five days I used that laptop, starting the HTML/CSS course on it. And then it died. No charging light, nothing. Word of warning to anyone looking to buy a windows laptop: don't buy through Micrsoft Store. I'm happy to say, that about three weeks after my laptop died, the replacement is finally in the mail. Yes you read that right, I don't actually have the replacement yet. But that's life. No point going on about it (more than I already have, at least). I'm looking forward to the new laptop's arrival, it's really a treat to use. Oh right, and the lesson I learned? BACKUP EVERYTHING! All my classwork is done on onedrive now.
