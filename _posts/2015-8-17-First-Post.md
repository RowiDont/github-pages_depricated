Current projects I am working on:

- Setting up a blog on Github
  - Learning about the power of jekyll
  - Learning as much as possible about github (also Markdown )
- Completing the [Web Development course on Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/web-development--cs253)
  - Learn what a web app is! A a long held dream of mine
  - Build the blog as described in the course syllabus, and use it and develop it to replace this one (maybe)
- Turn my laptop into a hackintosh
  - Learn how operating systems work, and how hardware and even BIOS interface with regular usage
  - Learn why OS X is the OS of choice for so many developers
  
As I make progress on any of these fronts, I will update the blog. The title will have one of three subjects included in it: _Github_, _WebDev_, or _Hackintosh_. Random posts will say _Misc_ - or something.
