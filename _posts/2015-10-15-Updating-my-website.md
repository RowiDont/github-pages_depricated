As you may notice (the one person who have seen this blog in the past month), my site design has changed. I was pretty peeved that I was becoming a web developer yet somehow I didn't have my own website, rather relying on Poole, the default Jekyll theme.

The journey into customizing Jekyll to fit my tastes was pretty educational. I won't pretend like I fully understand the magic that is Jekyll, BUT I do finally understand most of the pieces. It was nice that I can now add menus to my site relatively quickly, thanks to my HTML/CSS and responsive design classes.

### Community

I relied on quite a few jekyll blog posts to figure out this website, and it's made me reconsider what I want to do on my blog. I think, in addition to keeping up on my progress, I'd like to write tutorials and general help guides for people also starting out with web development.

Every time I struggle with a concept or idea, and finally reach an answer, why not share it?

### Mobile design principles

If you checkout this site on your phone, you'll notice that I opted for an unconventional menu. No hamburgers here. And that's because I have never liked he hamburger. So you can imagine my delight when I found [this](https://lmjabreu.com/post/why-and-how-to-avoid-hamburger-menus/) excellent write-up by Louie A on the numerous issues with the hamburger.
