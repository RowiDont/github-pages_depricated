_Hey there, stranger!_

### Who am I?

My name is Rafi, and I'm a web developer in training. This blog is meant to chronicle my growth as a web dev, through personal projects, classes, and anything else relevant to becoming a world class programmer. If you have any questions or positive comments (neutral/negative comments are cool too I guess), check out my deets below.
